I Like
- The flows are intuitive and responsive with immediate feedback.
- The mobile‑first layout and large tap targets reduce friction.
- The pie chart and legend communicate balance at a glance.
- Seed data shows value quickly; Info page orients first‑time users.
- A/B setup for the add flow is a smart way to validate speed.

I Wish
- Edit/delete with a quick undo would keep data clean and reduce anxiety.
- Presets and recent titles available everywhere would speed repetitive logging.
- Stronger focus states, higher contrast, and clearer validation would enhance accessibility.
- Time ranges and trend indicators would make insights actionable.
- A micro‑tour would highlight the core steps and reduce first‑use confusion.

I Wonder
- Adaptive suggestions for duration or category could lower cognitive load.
- Gentle reminders might prompt timely logging without being intrusive.
- Sharing summaries with a coach or friend could improve accountability.
- Microcopy and CTA placement tweaks may improve conversion.
- Weekly goals and streaks could motivate behavior change.
