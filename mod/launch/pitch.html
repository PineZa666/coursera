    <h1>Balancr — Mobile Time Balance Tracker</h1>
    <h2>Hook</h2>
    <p>People struggle to balance work, health, and play. Balancr makes logging effortless and shows imbalance instantly so users can act.</p>
    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>Existing trackers either demand too much input or hide insights behind complexity. Users abandon them before getting value.</p>
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>Fast logging with presets, a clear pie‑chart overview, and minimal friction. In a minute, anyone can see and adjust their balance.</p>
    <h2>Unique Point of View</h2>
    <p>Prioritize momentum over granularity. Balancr optimizes the 30‑second interaction that keeps a habit alive and useful.</p>
    <h2>Key Design Insight</h2>
    <p>Preset durations and a prominent CTA reduce time‑to‑submit and hesitation. Visualization must be glanceable and immediate.</p>
    <h2>Why This Beats Alternatives</h2>
    <p>Lower cognitive load, fewer fields, and instant feedback make everyday logging practical. Complexity is optional, not required.</p>
    <h2>Proof Through Testing</h2>
    <p>User testing and A/B experiments compare conversion and speed between the original form and the preset‑enhanced redesign.</p>
    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <p>Edit/delete, trends over time, and lightweight reminders. Expand presets and onboarding micro‑tour to sustain engagement.</p>
